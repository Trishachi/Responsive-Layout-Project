# Responsive-Layout-Project

In this project, I practised creating a responsive porfolio page using the mobile first design approach.

The design has 3 different layouts for Screens sizes:
* 1024 pixels and above
* 768 pixels and above
* below 768 pixels

The layout will automatically adjust to the screen size of the user.
